# xtext2vscode-example

Based on the language and the tutorial: <https://idiomaticsoft.com/post/2022-04-25-lsp-xtext-tutorial-intro/>

However, I choose to make a self-contained VSCode extension, which is based on: <https://github.com/cdietrich/xtext-languageserver-example/>

Guess the reason why it's not working:

1. Problems with the vsc plugin (high chance).
2. Problems with the server (med chance).
1 + 2. Problems with both.
3. Problems with gradle (low chance).
